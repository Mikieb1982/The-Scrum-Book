# Server configuration

The Express server now initialises the Firebase Admin SDK directly from a downloaded service-account JSON file. This avoids copy/paste mistakes when populating environment variables and ensures the Admin SDK receives the credential exactly as generated by Firebase.

## Provide your service account file

1. Download a service account key for your Firebase project from the Firebase Console.
2. Move the downloaded JSON file into the `server` directory (next to `index.js`).
3. Update the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` constant at the top of `server/index.js` so that it matches the filename you just added.

On startup the server verifies that the file exists, logs the project ID it finds inside, and initialises the Firebase Admin SDK with that credential. If the file is missing or cannot be parsed the code logs an error and falls back to the default `admin.initializeApp()` call so that the rest of the application can continue to serve mock data.

## Behaviour without credentials

When a valid credential cannot be loaded the server still responds, but Firestore-backed routes fall back to mock responses:

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:3001/api/users/demo/profile
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
...
{"error":"Firestore is not configured"}
```

Once the service account file is in place the log will include a confirmation similar to:

```
âœ… Initializing Firebase with service account: your-project-id
```

and Firestore data will be returned in subsequent API calls.
